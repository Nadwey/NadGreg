GregTech Community Pack Modern, but *more interesting*...

## Playing

Playing is not recommended yet, since the modpack is still in pre-alpha.

However, you can download unstable builds from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Nadwey/NadGreg/actions/workflows/build.yml), or [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/Nadwey/NadGreg/workflows/build/1.20.1?preview).

## Building

[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) will allow you to build either a server or client pack.
Please refer to their tutorials page for more info.

## Server

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

Run `build.bat` or `build.sh` in `serverpack/`.

Your server pack will be created in `serverpack/pack/`.
